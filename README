NAME
    WebService::Amazon::Support - The great new WebService::Amazon::Support!

VERSION
    Version 0.0.1

SYNOPSIS
    This module provides a Perl wrapper around Amazon's Support API (
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>
    ). You will need to be an AWS customer with an ID and Secret which has
    been provided access to Support.

    Note: Some parameter validation is purposely lax. The API will generally
    fail when invalid params are passed. The errors may not be helpful.

        use WebService::Amazon::Support;

        my $sup = WebService::Amazon::Support->new( param => { id     => $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
                                                               secret => $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET } );
        ...

INTERFACE
  new
    Inherited from WebService::Simple, and takes all the same arguments. You
    must provide the Amazon required arguments of id, and secret in the
    param hash:

        my $sup = WebService::Amazon::Support->new( param => { id     => $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
                                                               secret => $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET } );
